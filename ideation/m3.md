### Key Features and Structure of a Decentralized Hosting Platform

1. **GitHub Integration for Seamless Deployment**
   - **OAuth Integration**: Use GitHub’s OAuth for account linking and authorization, allowing users to connect their GitHub repositories. This will enable you to access their repositories and trigger deployment workflows.
   - **Continuous Deployment**: Implement a webhook that listens for changes (e.g., commits, PRs) on a linked GitHub repository, automatically updating the hosted site whenever changes are detected.

2. **Decentralized Storage for Permanence**
   - **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** or **Arweave**: Use IPFS for hosting static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), which will ensure the content remains decentralized and accessible through a unique content hash (CID).
   - **Arweave**: For users who want data permanence without the risk of content disappearing (e.g., if no one “pins” it), Arweave offers a pay-once, store-forever model, which may be more reliable for long-term storage.
   - **Dynamic Site Handling**: For dynamic sites, you could support **Fleek** or **Skynet** to enable decentralized hosting that can work with serverless functions, managing dynamic backends while still remaining largely decentralized.

3. **Domain Management**
   - **ENS (Ethereum Name Service)** or **Handshake**: Offer users the option to create a decentralized domain (e.g., `.eth` or `.hns` domain) mapped to their site’s IPFS hash. Alternatively, you could provide subdomains for free, such as `username.yourplatform.eth`.
   - **DNSLink**: For traditional `.com` or `.io` domains, IPFS allows for DNSLink, which maps a domain name to an IPFS hash, letting you offer both decentralized domain options and compatibility with traditional domains.

4. **Deployment Pipeline with GitHub Actions**
   - **Automated IPFS Deployment**: Set up a GitHub Action that automatically pushes a new version of the website to IPFS whenever a commit is made. You can make this a part of the user’s repository or as a service your platform offers, so every update is instantly deployed.
   - **Automated Arweave/Skynet Uploads**: Similar to IPFS, build automation that will push changes to Arweave or Skynet for users who prefer these options for redundancy or performance.

5. **User Dashboard for Site Management**
   - Provide users with a **simple dashboard** to manage deployments, view IPFS or Arweave links, and update domains.
   - Allow users to **monitor storage costs and usage** (for Arweave) and manage configurations for caching and performance.

6. **Subdomain Provisioning and SSL Support**
   - **Subdomain Assignment**: Offer free subdomains (e.g., `username.platform.com`) or custom domains via DNSLink.
   - **SSL Support**: SSL on IPFS can be tricky since it’s a peer-to-peer network, but you can integrate it with services like **Cloudflare’s IPFS gateway**, which provides HTTPS support.
