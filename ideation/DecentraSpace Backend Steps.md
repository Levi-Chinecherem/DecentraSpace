## DecentraSpace Backend Development Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup
1. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Use `venv` or `virtualenv` to create an isolated environment.
   - Command: `python -m venv venv` or `virtualenv venv`

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. **Install Django and Required Libraries**
   - Use `pip` to install Django and other necessary packages.
   - Command: `pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers`

4. **Create a New Django Project**
   - Command: `django-admin startproject decentralspace`

5. **Set Up Project Structure**
   - Create a new app for user management: `python manage.py startapp user_management`
   - Repeat for other modules as needed (e.g., `github_integration`, `billing`, `storage`, etc.).

### Step 2: User Management and Authentication
1. **Set Up User Model**
   - Extend Django's `AbstractUser` to create a custom user model with wallet and tier attributes.

2. **Implement Wallet Authentication**
   - Use web3 libraries (e.g., `web3.py`) for wallet signature verification.
   - Create endpoints for login and user registration.

3. **Admin Panel API**
   - Use Django admin to manage users and their subscription tiers.
   - Set up endpoints for admin operations (e.g., update user tiers).

### Step 3: GitHub Integration
1. **Integrate GitHub API**
   - Use `requests` or `httpx` to communicate with the GitHub API.
   - Set up OAuth for account linking and management.

2. **Create Deployment Trigger**
   - Implement webhook endpoints to handle deployment requests from GitHub.

3. **Develop Unlink/Re-Link Endpoints**
   - Create API endpoints for linking/unlinking GitHub accounts.

### Step 4: Billing and Credit System
1. **Set Up Payment Processing**
   - Integrate payment systems like Paystack or cryptocurrency payments via `web3.py`.

2. **Implement Credit Management**
   - Create models to track user credits and their usage.
   - Develop endpoints for checking balance, deducting credits, and recharging.

3. **Service-Specific Billing Logic**
   - Implement logic to deduct credits based on service usage.

### Step 5: Decentralized Storage and File Management
1. **Integrate IPFS and Arweave**
   - Use libraries like `ipfshttpclient` for IPFS interactions.
   - Set up endpoints for file uploads and folder management.

2. **Implement Service Management**
   - Develop logic for pausing and resuming storage services.

### Step 6: Domain Name and DNS Management
1. **Domain Purchase and Management**
   - Implement domain purchasing logic, either through a third-party API or directly.
   - Create endpoints for linking and unlinking domains.

2. **Verify Domain Ownership**
   - Use blockchain verification methods to ensure users own domains.

### Step 7: Site Hosting and Deployment Management
1. **Set Up Hosting Services**
   - Create models and endpoints for managing static and dynamic hosting services.

2. **Deployment Monitoring**
   - Implement monitoring logic for deployment status and uptime tracking.

3. **Service Expiration Control**
   - Develop logic to handle expiration of free-tier sites.

### Step 8: Smart Contract and Blockchain Integration
1. **Credit Management Smart Contracts**
   - Develop smart contracts for credit management, including deductions and recharges.

2. **Domain Ownership Verification**
   - Implement smart contracts to verify domain ownership.

3. **Event Listeners**
   - Set up listeners for credit-related events to manage service activation/deactivation.

### Step 9: Analytics and Performance Monitoring
1. **User Analytics**
   - Implement models to collect and analyze site performance metrics.

2. **Credit Usage Analytics**
   - Develop reporting mechanisms for credit usage.

3. **System Health Monitoring**
   - Implement backend health checks and logging mechanisms.

### Step 10: Testing and Documentation
1. **Write Unit Tests**
   - Use Django’s testing framework to write tests for all endpoints and logic.

2. **Create API Documentation**
   - Use tools like Swagger or Django Rest Framework's built-in documentation features.

3. **Deploy the Backend**
   - Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean) and set up your deployment environment.

### Step 11: Final Integration and Review
1. **Integrate Frontend with Backend**
   - Ensure frontend can consume all backend APIs correctly.

2. **Conduct User Acceptance Testing**
   - Gather feedback from users to improve the system.

3. **Launch the System**
   - Go live with the backend and monitor for issues.

### Tools and Libraries Summary
- **Django**: Framework for building the backend.
- **Django REST Framework**: For creating RESTful APIs.
- **web3.py**: To handle blockchain interactions.
- **IPFS & Arweave Libraries**: For decentralized file storage.
- **Payment Libraries**: For payment processing (e.g., Paystack).
- **Testing Tools**: Django’s built-in testing tools for unit testing.

This modular and step-by-step approach will ensure that each component is fully developed and functional before moving on to the next. Whenever you need specific code for a step, just let me know!
