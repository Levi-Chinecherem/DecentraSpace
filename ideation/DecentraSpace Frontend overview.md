Here's a comprehensive overview of the **web-based frontend architecture** for DecentraSpace, designed to handle all user interactions with the backend. The frontend will serve as the primary user interface, allowing users to navigate through services like hosting, billing, storage, and more, without exposing any business logic—since all core logic resides in the backend. The focus is on creating a highly intuitive, modular, and dynamic user interface that supports all the backend functionalities through clean API interactions.

### **DecentraSpace Frontend Overview**

The frontend architecture can be broken down into the following layers and components:

#### 1. **Frontend Stack**
   - **Framework**: React.js (or Vue.js as an alternative)
   - **State Management**: Redux (or Context API) for managing global application state, especially for authentication, user sessions, and data caching.
   - **Routing**: React Router for handling navigation between different sections of the application.
   - **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS for styling, with component libraries like Material-UI or Chakra UI to speed up development.

#### 2. **Core Modules**

Each module will serve a distinct purpose, handling a specific set of user interactions with backend endpoints.

1. **Authentication Module**
   - **Wallet Connect**: A modal allowing users to authenticate using wallet-based sign-in (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).
   - **Account Management**: User can select their account tier (Free or Paid), with options for upgrading if needed.
   - **Session Handling**: Manages user sessions securely, with token management and logout functionality.

2. **Dashboard Module**
   - **Overview Screen**: Shows a summary of user account details, current tier, linked services, and credit balance.
   - **Quick Links**: Provide shortcuts for frequently accessed services like hosting, storage, and domain management.
   - **Notification Center**: Alerts users to any credit-related or service expiration notifications.

3. **Hosting Management Module**
   - **Deployment Manager**: Provides options for deploying sites from GitHub, supporting both static and dynamic site deployments.
   - **Service Control**: Allows users to start, pause, and resume hosting services with real-time updates on service status.
   - **Resource Monitoring**: Displays hosting resources (e.g., bandwidth, storage used) and offers insights for upgrading based on usage.

4. **Domain Management Module**
   - **Domain Purchase and Renewal**: Interface for buying domains through a provider API, supporting both traditional and blockchain-based domains.
   - **DNS Settings**: Enables users to manage DNS records, allowing manual linking of domain names to hosting resources.
   - **Ownership Transfers**: Simple UI for transferring domain ownership to another wallet address.

5. **Storage Management Module**
   - **File Upload Interface**: Allows users to create folders, upload files (e.g., images, videos, documents), and store them in IPFS/Arweave for decentralized access.
   - **File Organization**: Users can categorize files in folders, providing quick access to IPFS URLs for each file.
   - **Access Control**: Option to set access permissions for files, either public or restricted by user’s choice.

6. **Billing and Credit Module**
   - **Credit Balance Display**: Displays real-time balance, tracking pay-as-you-go expenses for each service.
   - **Credit Purchase**: Interface for topping up credits using wallet-based payments.
   - **Billing History**: Shows a breakdown of expenses per service, helping users monitor their pay-as-you-use charges.
   - **Automatic Pause Notifications**: Notifies users if services are paused due to insufficient credits, providing an option to resume once credits are restored.

7. **Analytics Module**
   - **Performance Insights**: Provides visualized data on site traffic, server response times, uptime, and resource consumption for each deployed site.
   - **Usage Tracking**: Displays graphs and charts for storage and bandwidth usage, along with average and peak resource consumption.
   - **Actionable Insights**: Offers suggestions for optimizing costs or upgrading plans based on site traffic and resource usage patterns.

### **Frontend Data Flow & API Integration**

Each module on the frontend will communicate with the backend through RESTful APIs, following a structured flow:

1. **API Service Layer**:
   - **API Service Layer**: A dedicated service layer to centralize all API requests, with error handling, token management, and request retries.
   - **Authentication Interceptor**: Automatically attaches wallet authentication tokens to requests.

2. **Frontend State Management**:
   - **Global State**: Manage session-based data (e.g., user tier, credit balance) centrally, ensuring updates reflect across all modules.
   - **Local Component State**: Lightweight, component-level state for individual screens or user inputs.

3. **Data Caching & Revalidation**:
   - **Data Fetching Library**: Use libraries like SWR or React Query for real-time data fetching and caching, allowing efficient management of frequently accessed data (e.g., site metrics, credit balance).

### **Frontend UI/UX Design**

The UI/UX design should emphasize ease of use, consistency, and a professional look:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure compatibility across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Dark and Light Modes**: Provide theme toggling for user preference.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Use sidebars and top navigation bars to guide users through the modules with minimal clicks.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide advanced options until users require them, keeping the interface clean and approachable.

---

### **Frontend Security Considerations**

- **Wallet-Based Authentication**: Implement wallet-based authentication using secure providers and enable session expiry on the frontend.
- **SSL and HTTPS**: Ensure all API calls and assets are served securely over HTTPS.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect frontend actions that call sensitive endpoints (like billing or credit top-up) with rate limits.
- **Error Handling**: Provide user-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms for failed requests.
