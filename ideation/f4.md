## **DecentraSpace Overview**

**DecentraSpace** is a next-generation platform designed to provide decentralized web hosting, storage, and domain services with a strong focus on privacy, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. Users benefit from a range of options, allowing them to host static or dynamic sites, store assets, and manage domains in a decentralized and scalable manner.

### **Core Features of DecentraSpace**

1. **Account Tiers**
   - **Free Tier**: 
     - **Static Site Hosting** only, accessible via a default subdomain with no custom domain linking.
     - **GitHub Integration**: Link one GitHub account for deployment purposes.
     - **Site Expiration**: Free-tier sites have a 6-month lifespan. Users are prompted to upgrade to the paid tier upon expiry to maintain the site, or the site will be removed.
   - **Paid Tier**: 
     - Access to a full suite of services (detailed below) on a “pay-as-you-use” basis.
     - **GitHub Integration**: Link up to three GitHub accounts for free. Additional GitHub account links incur a charge. Paid users can also unlink and relink GitHub accounts as needed.
     - **Tier Migration**: Transitioning from free to paid tier requires a one-time credit fee.

2. **Hosting Services**
   - **Static Site Hosting**: For lightweight websites (HTML, CSS, JS).
   - **Dynamic Site Hosting**: Support for decentralized serverless backends to handle dynamic content.
   - **Custom Domains**: Paid users can link both traditional and decentralized domains (e.g., ENS, Handshake) through manual configuration.
   - **Site Expiration Management**: Admins have the flexibility to adjust the free-tier site lifespan (default at six months) for scalability.

3. **Domain Name Management**
   - **Traditional Domain Support**: Standard TLDs like .com and .net can be linked via DNSLink.
   - **Blockchain Domains**: Enable users to use blockchain-based domains.
   - **Domain Service Control**: Users can pause, resume, or remove domains based on credit availability.

4. **Decentralized Storage Solutions**
   - **IPFS**: Used for hosting static assets with caching for enhanced accessibility and speed.
   - **Arweave**: Provides permanent storage for content that requires indefinite availability.
   - **On-demand Static File Storage** (Paid Only): Users can organize and store individual files (e.g., images, videos, audio) in dedicated folders, each with a unique address for external access.
     - **IPFS Integration**: Supports decentralized storage for static files with folder management for easy organization.
     - **Access Control and Monitoring**: Users receive a unique address for accessing each file or folder from anywhere.

5. **Decentralized Database as a Service (DBaaS)**
   - **Database Access for Paid Tier**: Paid users gain access to decentralized databases for data-driven sites, with billing based on usage.
   - **Service Pausing**: Users control database access based on credit balance, pausing as needed.

6. **Billing and Cost Management**
   - **Pay-As-You-Use**: Charges for all services are usage-based, ensuring flexible costs. Services pause automatically if credits are depleted, resuming when credits are reloaded.
   - **Initial Cost Verification**: For services with upfront costs (e.g., domain registration, database setup), users’ credit balance is checked to ensure affordability.
   - **Continuous Costs**: Maintenance, automated deployments, and active services accrue charges as they are used.

7. **Service Control Features**
   - **Pause and Play**: Each service (hosting, domain, database, file storage) can be paused or resumed as needed.
   - **Service Removal**: Users can delete services to save on costs or free up resources.
   - **Admin-adjustable Expiration**: Free-tier expiration settings can be modified from the admin side.

8. **Deployment and GitHub Integration**
   - **Continuous Deployment**: Direct deployment from linked GitHub repositories for both static and dynamic sites.
   - **Credit-Based Cost for GitHub Links**: Free tier supports one GitHub account; paid tier includes three GitHub accounts free of charge, with additional accounts billed on a pay-as-you-go basis.

9. **Site Monitoring and Analytics (Paid Only)**
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time analytics for site traffic, load times, and resource utilization.
   - **User Insights**: Paid users receive insights into site performance to help optimize their user experience.

10. **Ownership and Collaboration**
    - **Smart Contract-Based Ownership**: Manage decentralized ownership transfers for hosted sites and domain names securely.
    - **Collaboration Options**: Users can transfer ownership between wallets for team-based work or partnerships.

### **Technological Stack**

- **Backend**: Django, handling API requests, smart contract interactions, and business logic.
- **Frontend**: React (or similar framework) for a streamlined interface.
- **Blockchain**: Low-fee blockchain (e.g., Polygon) to manage contract-based ownership and billing.
- **Storage**: IPFS and Arweave for distributed storage.
- **Database**: Decentralized database solutions like OrbitDB.

### **Conclusion**

DecentraSpace offers a decentralized, privacy-focused platform designed to adapt to user needs with flexible pricing. By incorporating anonymous access, a powerful range of services, and real-time control over usage, DecentraSpace ensures that developers and site owners have an accessible, scalable solution for web hosting and management in a decentralized world.
